- `Build 1:` Basic OS - my very first build.
  - Installed VsCode, Chrome, Bitwarden installed out of the box


- `Build 2:` Papol Linux - has a macos like theme, not perfect, very buggy 
  - The icons are not changed
  - loaded dconf dump manually after booting <-- **IMPORTANT TO FIX**
  - no any pre-installed apps
  - development purposes only
  - the plank dock should start on starup (I FORGOT TO INSTALL IT)
