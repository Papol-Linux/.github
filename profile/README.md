- 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - This is a highly customized version of Ubuntu (unofficial/community made) that works out of the box, perfectly and stably that looks just like a mac for the apple fans out there
- 🌈 Contribution guidelines - Its all still under development, You can contact me via an email: hirushaadi@gmail.com
- 🍿 Versions - I'm planning to make two versions, one aimed for the general user/newbie to linux and the other for developers with many useful tools, both mac-os themed
